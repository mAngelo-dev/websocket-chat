# Websocket-Chat (Java + Spring Boot)
This project is just for fun in a local network to connect two persons in a local network.
It was developed to understand how websockets work in Spring Boot and explore its functionality.

You can compile it and run on your network and with the help of postman or other clients you can connect using `ws://localhost:8080/chat`
